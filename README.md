# HomeMapper: AI-Powered 3D Floor Plan Generator

HomeMapper is an innovative project that leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer-aided design (CAD) to generate 3D floor plans from user descriptions. This repository contains the code for a web application built using Streamlit, which integrates with Blender, a popular 3D creation software, to create interactive and immersive 3D floor plans.

## Key Features

- **Speech-to-Text Input:** Users can describe their desired floor plan using voice commands, which are then transcribed into text using speech recognition technology.
- **AI-Powered 3D Modeling:** The transcribed text is then used to generate a 3D floor plan using a custom-built Blender script, which creates a 3D model based on the user's description.
- **Interactive Visualization:** The generated 3D floor plan is displayed in the web application, allowing users to interact with the model and explore different design options.
- **Firebase Integration:** User authentication and data storage are handled using Firebase, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.

## Technologies Used

- Streamlit (web application framework)
- Blender (3D creation software)
- Python (programming language)
- Firebase (authentication and data storage)
- Speech recognition technology (for speech-to-text input)

## Potential Applications

- **Architecture and Real Estate:** HomeMapper can be used by architects, designers, and real estate professionals to quickly generate 3D floor plans for clients and stakeholders.
- **Interior Design:** The application can be used by interior designers to create interactive 3D models of rooms and spaces, allowing clients to explore different design options.
- **Education and Training:** HomeMapper can be used in educational settings to teach students about architecture, design, and 3D modeling.
